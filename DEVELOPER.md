# Developer instructions

This document is to describe the rules of developing for this repository.
It also discusses the features and changes which will be in pipeline.

# Development plan
- [] Merge the code into main branch after making all changes in the current
    model.
    - [] Implement AR model process to highlight the choice of coefficients. Get
        a plot out of it marked with important parameters.
    - [] Write a script to highlight the values of tau and error associated with
        the choice.
    - [] Do simulation to highlight the relevance of value of pink noise
        B parameter, range of taus and tau1 highlighting the error
        contribution from each setting.
    - [] Simulate the effect of new parameters for each IMU.
- [] Tag the released branch and update documentation.
- [] Then create another branch for packaging the project.
